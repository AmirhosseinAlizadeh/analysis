#general.py  
The provided code is a Python class with several methods for performing various data manipulation tasks using Pandas DataFrame. The constructor method initializes the DataFrame by reading a CSV file, and a read_csv method is provided to read a CSV file with various optional parameters such as selecting a certain number of columns, selecting columns with specific names, and dropping missing values. The plot_data method can plot selected columns of the DataFrame using Matplotlib, with optional curve fitting, while the print_statistics method prints some summary statistics about the DataFrame. The get_fit_func function returns the appropriate fit function and initial parameter values for the specified curve fitting mode.   
Impedance Spectrospy  
Impedance spectroscopy is a technique that measures the impedance of a material or system as a function of frequency 
to extract information about its electrical and physical properties. 
An equivalent circuit model is commonly used to analyze the impedance data. 
The parallel_rc_series function models the equivalent impedance of parallel units of resistors and capacitors connected
in series, and the fit_parallel_rc_series function fits experimental impedance data to this model. 
These functions enable the analysis of impedance spectroscopy data to extract important information about the
 electrical and physical properties of a material or system.
